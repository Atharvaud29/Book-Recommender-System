# Book-Recommender-System

# Project Goal :

The primary goal is to build a personalized book recommendation system that leverages collaborative filtering techniques to suggest books to users. Specifically, the project aims to :

1. Personalize Recommendations: Use historical user interactions (like ratings or reviews) to identify users with similar tastes, thereby providing book suggestions that align with individual preferences.
2. Enhance Discovery: Help users discover new books they might not find on their own, improving overall user engagement and satisfaction.
3. Optimize User Experience: Increase the accuracy and relevance of recommendations, making the platform more engaging and user-friendly.
